# Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention

Most deep learning approaches for image processing captures texture information but not really
object information. Can we learn object representations in an unsupervised way which we can later
use for some task (knowing only about the objects and not the pixels themselves?).

Summary: Produce output vectors corresponding to an object in the input, where the vector is the properties of the object.

## Slot Attention Module

Map from N input features to K output vectors.
