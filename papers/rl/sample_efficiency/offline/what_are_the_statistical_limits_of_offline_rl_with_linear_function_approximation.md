In the context of supervised learning, it is "well knonw that empirical risk minimization is sample efficient if hte hypothesis class has bounded complexity". For example, if the agent is given a $d$ dimensional feature extractor and the ground-truth labelling function is a realizable linear function from those feature vectors, then a polynomial number of samples in $d$ is sufficient to learn the problem.
