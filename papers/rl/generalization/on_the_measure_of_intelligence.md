No Free Lunch theorem might say that any two algorithms will be equivalent when averaged over every possible problem, but the set of problems in the universe that is relevant to humans is a subset of that. General intelligence is not a binary property, rather it is a spectrum tied to the scope of application, the degree of efficacy in which the system may translate its priors and experience into new skills and the degree of generalization difficulty represented by different points in the scope.
