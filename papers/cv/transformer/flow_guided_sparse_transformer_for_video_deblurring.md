Customzies a self-attention module into the "Flow Guided Sparse Window based Multi Head Self-Attention"

For each query, use the estimated optimal flow to globally sample sparse key elements corresponding to the same scene patch in a neighbourhood.

Recurrent embedding mechanism to transfer information from parse frames and strength long term temporal dependencies.
