Discussion with the author:

 - What do you think is necessary? We can't really know for sure. You can suceed by interpolation. It seems intuitive that if you manage to disentangle representations, you could solve the problem. It seems that you need a level of abstraction. You neef a stronger inductive bias in your decoder itself. You need abstraction and binding.
