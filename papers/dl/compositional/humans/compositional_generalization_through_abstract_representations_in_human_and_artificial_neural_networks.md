title: "Compositional Generalization through Abstract Representations in Humans and Artificial Neural Networks"
---
Compare across human and anns.

Abstract representations directly inpact systrmatic compositional generalization.

Abstractions can be embedded into classic connectionist moddls through pretraining.
