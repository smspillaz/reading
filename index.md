In general people can learn and use novel functional concepts from very few examples (few-shot learning). People can also compose concepts in complex ways that go beyond the provided demonstrations. There are three inductive biases that people make: mutual exclusivity, one-to-one mapping and iconic concatenation. (See in general, Chomsky. N, 1957, Syntatctic Structures and Montague, R. (1970) Universal Grammar, Theoria 36, 373-398). Apparently the ability is also central to how people learn from few-shots (Fordor J. 1975, The Language of Thought; The compositionality papers).

How do these distinct specialists share information with each other? Global Workspace theory says that these specialists can interact with each other through a workspace. Information is written into the workspace in a competitive way. In this study they implement this concept of a "shared workspace" into RIM, Transformer, TIM and Universal Transformer. Compared to self-attention, the shared workspace is O(N) and not pairwise but rather global-to-local. This can improve specialization.

The basic idea is to parse the query sentence into a parse tree and assign roles to each of the words in a dependency parse. Then you to a sort of "coarse-to-fine" process up the tree, combining the argument embeddings in each relation with each word matched with object detection features in the image. So for example "a bald man is standing by the beer pumps at the bar" would match "beer" and "pumps", then combine with "the (NN) (NN)" and match "the beer pumps" and so on until you get a final matching score. There are also some loss functions like "multi-scale visual alignment loss" (which computes the loss for each concept up the hierarchy with positive and negative examples) as well as an order-preserving loss, eg, coarser grained concepts should match the image less than finer-grained ones. The model does quite well on realistic out-of-distribution data, at least better than ViLBERT does, but there is still some room for improvement.

The encoder matters a lot. But one problem with clip is that you have shallow fusion (eg, the fusion happens at the end) and not deep fusion like other VQA models. So in this paper they use CLIP as the visual encoder. CLIP can be easily integrated into existing models and supports fast inference. CLIP can serve as a drop-in replacement on previous in-domain dependent encoders. [[papers/dl/contrastive/how_much_can_clip_benefit_vision_and_language_tasks.md|Notes]]

You can in-fact apply meta-learning algorithms like ProtoNet here, where the augmented views make the support set, and then you have to get the query set correct, which is equivalent to contrastive learning.

If you try to fix this by penalizing unconditional mutual information, things get worse because the correlation between the generative factors and the noise is actually a predictive feature. The solution is to penalize *conditional* mutual information, eg $I(z_0, ..., z_k|s_j)$. because we can assume that the latent factors are independent once we know something about one of the generative factors (eg, knowing $s_j$ means that $z_{k}$ does not tell us any more about $z_i$). Then the authors provide a mechanism to try and extend this idea to a training process, by taking two samples with a shared generative factor, then shuffling the latents for all the other latent variables and discriminating between the true and shuffled cases.

Realistic datasets have correlations between factors of variation. This work performs a large scale empirical investigation as to whether current disentanglement methods can still learn good representations when the dataset is correlated. Weaker correlations are easier to disentangle. It may be possible to resolve latent entanglement post-hoc by predicting ground truth labels from entangled dimensions using a few examples.

### vqvae
 - [[pdfs/dl/disentanglement/vqvae/discrete_valued_neural_communication_in_structured_architectures_enhances_generalization.pdf|Discrete-Valued Neural Communication in Structured Architectures Enhances Generalization]]: The nature of structured models is that you have communiation among components with a bottleneck. In this work, tighten the bottleneck using discreteness and a VQ-VAE. They do multi-headed discreteness with shared codebooks. Discrete Valued Neural Communication substantially improves systematic generalization in variety of architectures, eg, transformers, modular architectures, GNNs, etc. The basic idea is that you introduce a discrete latent space vector (eg, an L-way categorical variable), so you quantise and concatenate the results for each “head” of some continuous vector in a feedforward network (eg, $h \to s_0, …, s_G, s_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m/G}$). Each segment is discretized by picking the closest neighbour in the codebook. Its basically VQ-VAE for anything. They get good OOD performance on sort-of-CLEVR, movement prediction in Atari, grid-world object movement prediction (OOD is that there are five objects in training, three objects in OOD-1 and two objects in OOD-2), 3-body physics object movement prediction (OOD ball sizes).

The first view is the statistical one, which says that if the invariant feature is not fully predictive, then the bayes-optimal classifier will necessarily rely on spuriously correlated features to get a better result. But even if the invariant feature *is* fully predictive, classifiers tend to rely on these sorts of spurious correlations anyway. This reliance goes away over time in the limit of gradient descent, but there is another failure mode, geometric, that doesn't, becuase of non-trivial geometry.

Effectively, explicit modification of the solution is performed at each step so as to maintain a desired level of sparsity. Only parameters that are not penalized by the constraint are updated first, then update parameters for which decreasing their absolute value decreases the loss, then update the most important parameters such that their absolute value increases but the loss decreases, then update rest of the parameters which are not important by decreasing their absolute value.

They come up with a Neural Data Router which acheives 100% length generalization accuracy.  Their contributions are a copy gate and geometric attention. The copy-gate is essentially just a residual connection with gating on the transformer layer, though it is parameterized by the result of the self-attention as opposed to by a single weight. Geometric attention attends to the closest-mathcing-element.  Instead of softmax, do sigmoid. Diagonal zero-ed out. Then attention is computed between $i$ and $j$ using source indices which are closer to $i$ than $j$, then you take the product over the converse all of them. The result is that if other things have some probability weight, then they make $A_{ij}$ smaller.

### sparse
 - [[pdfs/dl/transformer/sparse/attention_with_sparsity_regularization.pdf|Attention With Sparsity Regularization for Neural Machine Translation and Summarization.]]: (cite: journals/taslp/ZhangZLZ19) Proposes a sparse attention model in which the sparsity regularization term is designed to augment the objective function. Two kinds of regularization explored: $L_{\infty}$  and entropy minimization. The L1 norm is not really suitable for regularizing the attention mask because it is always 1 (note: you can use it on the outer product before the attention mask is computed!). The $L_{\infty}$ norm regularizer effectively maximizes the biggest value and penalizes everything else. The minimum entropy regularizer takes an information theoretic approach and tries to make the attention distribution as sparse as possible .

Also demonstrates how sparser versions of common architectures can run with significantly fewer resources. It does not require computing the dense parameters first and then sparsifying later. Instead, it consists of selecting some subset of the parameters that correspond to the top-K parameters by parameter magnitude for each training step, then applying gradient steps to a superset of those. Then there's an auxiliary exploration loss to encourage the sparsity mask to adapt during training. To put it another way, you still keep all those parameters in memory, but you select one set to use for the foward pass and a superset of those to update using gradient descent.

We don't just want to reconstruct the image but we want to recombine the slots with novel combinations. Existing methods have inconsistent composition problems, eg, if you take the floor slot from one, the wall slot from another and the object slot from a third, then mixing them together results in an inconsistent rendering. DALL-E can smoothly stitch together things by using a transformer decoder. (SLATE: Slot-Attention Transformer). Instead of a mixture decoder use a transformer decoder which renders each pixel one-by-one autoregressively conditioned on the input slots. The model can still discover objects like the mixture-decoder based models. This model renders consistently compared to [[slot_attention]]. Its a text-free DALL-E model, the inputs are slots instead of text descriptions. [[papers/dl/transformer/vision_text/illiterate_dall_e_learns_to_compose.md|Notes]]

The "access effect" is such that improved data efficiency enables new applications in data limited domains. The "performance effect" (not be confused with the "access effect") is about how much data is required to get superior performance, and here the power law and law of diminishing returns still applies - the base amount of data required to get started is lower and the exponential curve might be slightly flatter, but it is still exponential. .

They address the issue by introuding categorisation to the source contextualized representations. They find prototypes of token representations over the training set and then integrate the embeddings into the encoding. Results in a 24% error rate reduction on CoGnition. They use a thing called a Proto-transformer. Proto-transformer does something called “prototype-attention”. You cluster the contextualized representations of each token to obtain prototype representations eg using kmeans. Then in the prototype transformer you do attention between prototypes and prototypes based on the lookup table.

The method works by assigning structural worles to words, then combines word and role vectors using a closed form equation with learned parameters (elementwise product plus bias). Role embeddings can be seen like positional embeddings. ROLE learns to compute the role labels. It learns a dictionary of $n_R$ role embeddings and or each input symbol, does soft attention over these role vectors. Role-attention is encouraged to be one-hot. They also trained on some partly-compositional tasks (InferSent, Skip-thought, Stanford Sentiment Model and SPINN).

So they proposesequence-to-sequence models that are disentangled. The disentanglement happens by adaptively re-encoding the source input (eg, condition the source representations on the newly decoded target context, rather than capturing it all in a single forward pass). Basically their architecture is that on every decoding step, you pass the previously decoded targets to the encoder as well as part of the context (as  opposed to doing causal prediction in the decoder). They also applied their approach on CoGnition. [[papers/nlp/compositional/disentangled_sequence_to_sequence_learning_for_compositional_generalization.md|Notes]]

Defines a formal notion of fairness and applies these ideas to natural language inference by construction challenging but provably fair artificial datasets  Composition trees are defined using formal logic. A function $F$ with respect to a dataset is fair if the baseline model (not statistical! rule based) can learn $F$ from the training data. The paper then looks at statistical models on a provably fair function and dataset. The standard statistical models and attention based models don't do all that well on test data. The paper concludes that the problem is with the architecture, eg, recursive computation is required .

On Question Answering and Fact Verification, ReACT overcomes the issues of hallucination and error propagation which can be prevalent in chain-of-thought prompting. ReACT can also do well on ALFWorld and WebShop decisionmaking benchmarks. Basically it combines reasoning with actions, where the actions are things like searching a database for mroe information. An example “Aside from Apple Remote, what other device can control the program that Apple Remote was originally designed for” -> to solve this task you need to search “the program Apple Remote was originally designed for”, then find the “other device that can control that program”. Chain-of-thought prompting means that you don’t search the database, so you hallucinate. If you just have a database search, the database might not give you the exact answer you want. .

This paper presents a method for interpolating between easy-to-learn and the target task by defining a parameterized distribution over the task space. Parameterize the distribution by the expected reward that the agent will get when performing a task. Then maximize the expected task reward - KL divergence of the task distribution vs the "target" task distribution. Initially the agent will only be able to solve easy tasks, so we take a high KL penalty in order to maximize reward. But as we can solve more tasks, the task distribution drifts closer to the true task distribution. [[papers/rl/exploration/self_paced_deep_reinforcement_learning.md|Notes]]

In reality, the features tend to form clusters, so you can estimate the value function more effectively if you know which cluster you belong to. This work introduces a "attention-based" value function, which basically learns some attention weights to figure out which cluster to pay attention to. The work goes further to introduce a method to *sparsify* that attention over the course of training, with a loss function to ensure that there is both sparsity *and* diversity in terms of chosen clusters over the entire dataset. The authors show through their experiments that the sparse attention model used to estimate value leads to policies that significantly outperform a baseline CNN/LSTM/PPO, and furthermore that sparsity actually helps significantly in this area.

The environment is set up in a way that there is no supervision on the symbol grounding - the agent only gets a reward if it delivers the message correctly, but it must learn to do the symbol grounding itself. The authors develop a model called EMMA "Entity Mapper with Multi-Modal Attention", which in brief encodes text using BERT, then does attention between the encoded text and the symbol embeddings and re-weights the symbols according to this attention. The idea is that the value function should extract information relevant to the entity's role in the world (eg, "enemy, chasing etc"). The authors found that the model could get good generalization on held-out test games with unseen symbol-role combinations (so the model had seen the symbol before, but not in the role as indicated by the language statement). Also they performed a qualitative analysis where they looked at the attention head for language/objects and found that there was sparsity.

The agent "learns to relate linguistic symbols to emergent perceptual representations of its physical surroundings and pertinent sequences of actions". The agent's comprehension extends beyond prior experience enabling it to apply "familiar language to unfamiliar situations". The environment is DeepMind Lab. The authors find that language learning is contingent on a combination of reinforcement and unsupervised learning. The authors find that semantic knowledge acquired generalizes zero-shot to "new situations and new language." Also, the authors find that due to the sparse reward, you really need to use some sort of unsuperivsed auxiliary objective to model the dynamics, otherwise you will not learn anything . The paper finds that word learning is much faster if some other words outside the current training set are already known, because the model has learned to ground words with objects in general.  The paper also studied a colour-shape composition experiment and found good performance on unseen compositions of objects.

Proposes a "compositional network" architecture to solve some of the tasks in gSCAN. The architecture in brief parses the language statement using a dependency parser, then allocates each word an RNN. These RNNs are used to condition attention, which are then passed up the tree to the next words. On the red squares split the model does OK, but better than the baseline.

The agent can also produce a boolean expression of its understanding of the current task (using [[a_boolean_task_algebra_for_reinforcement_learning]]). So for example, if you have 15 different objects that you can pick up, you have a bitset of $2^{15}$ different combinations of picking up that can be learned. The main idea is that you can solve any new task in the set of tasks if "we are given the correct boolean expression that informs the agent how to compose its optimal skills".

One of the models proposed is BERT + cross-modal self-attention, where the authors state that there is an explicit pathway to bind visual experience to specific contextual word representations. In this model, you treat the channels as word-like entities and then compute attention between the flattenend channels and the word embeddings.

A planner reasons over the map and behaviour distributions to solve for a policy by imitating previous trajectories. Defines a probabilistic graphical model, where the world state is conditioned on the command, the behaviours are conditioned on the world state and command and the probability of a trajectory are conditioned on behaviours, world state and command. Then the planning module tries to find a plan with maximal likelihood in the data given the world model, statement and behaviour distrubiton.

They propose tools for constructing equivariant seq2seq models and do experiments on SCAN. Analyze existing models under lens of equivariance and demonstrate that an equivariant architecture can get good compositional generalization. Local group operation: Permutation of the word indices. Basically you can get verb replacement, but you cannot get conjunction replacement. Eg, WALK LEFT AND RUN -> JUMP LEFT AND RUN (LTURN WALK RUN -> LTURN JUMP RUN), but not RUN LEFT AND WALK -> RUN LEFT AFTER WALK (LTURN RUN WALK -> WALK LTURN RUN). This latter form is *global equivariance*. To make an equivariant sequence-to-sequence model, they use something called *group convolutions*. Each word gets transformed into a permutation equivariant embedding. Permutation equivariant embeddings are those where replacing, eg, LEFT with RIGHT leaves the embedding unchanged. Then you have permutation equivariant RNNs and permutation equivariant attention. This model requies knowing the permutation symmetries of interest, eg, knowing that LEFT and RIGHT have symmetry. Future work suggestions include grouping by parts of speech, learning the grouping and parameterizing the symemtry group and learning operations end-to-end by group structure. .

Proposes two new mechansims. The first is that to do generalization, proposes enforcing "analogies" so that two task encodings, both modified to change aspect X to value Y, have the same distance from the old task to the new task. The second is a "meta-controller" to handle the "long compositions of tasks" problem. This meta-controller has a kind of memory for every sub-task that it needs to complete and a mechanism to update which is the current active subtask.

The paper originally set our to explore generalization after consuming a single video demonstration as part fo the model input, but also incorporated natural language descriptions as encoded by a sentence encoder. The model decomposes the task of predicting the goal state and predicting the reward/value of an observed state given the predicted goal state. The model architecture is simple - just a convolutional network combined with LSTM encodings of the sentence using FiLM. In the zero-shot setting the model was tuned by validating on one OOD candidate and testing on the other. Using language descriptions you can get decent OOD performance, but there is a caveat in the way that the model was tuned.

Suboptimality defined as $\sup_{s \ in S} V^{\pi^*}(s) - V^{\pi^*_{\text{hier}}}(s)$, eg the worst case value function drop when using the optimal hierarchical policy compared to a normal optimal policy. This implies that you should set $k$-step goals such that a $k$-step goal reaching policy's state distribution energy function parameterized by the distance t othe goal is the *close to* the next-state distribution for the optimal policy. The low-level policy's reward is basically then the distance to the predicted goal plus the log-probability of its next-state transition. The experiments show that in an ant-navigation environment, the proposed method learns to represent the state as something close to x,y coordinates and predict the goals in terms of those x-y coordinates  [[papers/rl/hrl/hindsight/representation_learning_hrl.md|Notes]]

 - [[pdfs/rl/hrl/representations/language_as_abstraction_hrl.pdf|Language as an Abstraction for Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning.]]: (cite: conf/nips/JiangGMF19) Proposes to use language as the abstraction for hierarchical reinforcement learning, since it provides unique compositional structure and could enable fast learning and combinatorial generalization. Learns an instruction-following low-level policy and a high-level policy that can re-use linguistic abstractions across tasks. Uses hindsight along with a re-labelling engine to re-label end-states with the correct goal so as to enable hindsight learning of the low-level policy. Similar to HER in that instead of re-labelling states as goals, you re-label them with the appropriate language. The high level policy produces language statements, the low-level policy consumes those language statements in order to determine its actions. This approach was tested in an environment where the tasks are more abstract, for example, objects should be sorted by size (so the high level policy creates instructions which tell the low-level policy how the objects should be re-ordered). The paper also studied compositional generalization, for example, in the training set "red" appears only in the first half of the instruction and in the test set "red" appears only in the second half.  The paper also propses to learn a "disentanged representaiton of language" using an InfoGAN and vector quantization. [[papers/rl/hrl/representations/language_as_abstraction_hrl.md|Notes]]

There is a goal autoencoder which uses vector quantization to represent subgoals. These subgoals come from end-states within an 8-step replay buffer. The idea is to condition the worker policy on the *decoded*g goals (eg, not the discrete codes themselves. There is then a reward function that measures the similarity between the current state $s_t$ and the current goal $g$, for which they use cosine similarity. The nice thing about this approach is that you can use it entirely with pixels and train end-to-end with a sparse reward, there's no need for any sort of hindsight goal relabelling.

 - [[pdfs/rl/imitation/adverarial_imitation_learning.pdf|Adversarial Soft Advantage Fitting - Imitation Learning without Policy Optimization.]]: (cite: conf/nips/BardeRJPPN20) Proposes to remove policy optimization from the adversarial imitation learning process by instead leveraging a novel discriminator formulation. The discriminator directly learns the optimal generator policy and therefore solves the generator's optimization problem "for free". This removes the reinforcement learning phase alltogether.  Effectively the optimal discriminator parameter is the "expert distribution" which in this case is the policy that we would have used RL To solve for. This policy matches the expert's trajectory distribution. Adversarial Soft Advantage Fitting alternates between two steps - first trinaing the discriminator by minimizing hte binary cross entropy loss between the discriminator's output on trajectories that came from the generator and trajectories that came from the expert, then updating the generator to maximize the discriminator loss.

CRR reduces offline policy optimization to a form of value-filtered regression which requires minimal algorithmic changes to standard actor-critic method. The main gist is that where trajectories are sub-optimal, only update the policy from the data where the Q-estimate indicates that the action taken in the data is better than the action that would have been taken by the policy. This means that you do not use the computed advantages when training the policy at all - just optimize the log-likelihood of actions which have a better Q-estimate than what the current policy would have chosen .

To address the first problem, learn arbitrary nonlinear cost functions with a neural network. To deal with the second problem, formulate a sample-based approximation for MaxEnt. In Guided Cost Learning, you match the maximum entropy cost distribution (where the cost is the energy function) by optimizing a trajectory distribution with respect to the current cost using RL. Use the samples to both improve the policy and estimate the partition function. This basically requires both offline data and also a few online trajectories where you don't know the reward function but you optimize the online policy according to what your current estimate of the cost function is. .

AIRL is capable of recovering reward functions robust to changes in dynamics. Compared to GAIL, GAIL doesn't attempt to recover a reward function, it just attempts to recover a discriminator for trajectories and therefore the policy for the expert via the generator. This work builds on GAIL by using a discriminator that corresponds to an odds-ratio between the policy and exponentiated reward distribution. In the single state and action case you have $D_{\theta}(s, a) = \frac{\exp{f_{\theta}(s, a)}}{\exp{f_{\theta}(s, a)} + \pi(a|s)}$ and at optimality, $f$ equasl the log-policy.  The problem is reward ambiguiuty. The paper goes on to formulate what a "disentangled reward function" is (eg, one where the optimal policy is the same no matter what the dynamics).  To remove unwanted reward shaping with arbitrary reward function classes, the learned reward can only depend on $s$.  The paper proposes to instead limit $f$ to be a composition of $g$ and $h$, where $h$ is the reward shaping term. [[papers/rl/offline/robust_rewards_with_adversarial_inverse_rl.md|Notes]]

Leverage the idea that any trajectory is a successful demonstration of reaching its final state. Propose a simple algorithm where the agent continually relabels and imitates trajectories that it generates to progressively learn new goal-reaching behaviours from scratch. Essentially, collect policy rollouts, relabel the goals, then do behavioural cloning on those relabelled trajectories. There is no need to maintain an estimate of the value function. Authors then tested this method in a goal-conditioned setup. Starting from scratch, GSCL can beat TD3-HER - the inputs to the policy are the goal and the states and at the end of each episode you either relabel the trajectory and give a reward of zero, or give a reward of 1 and don't relabel. When comparing with PPO, there is no goal-relabelling, so instead a surrogate $\epsilon$-ball indicator reward function is given and the hindsight methods can still beat this.

Summarized what makes offline reinforcement learning difficult, namely that you cannot explore the environment, so one assumption that you have to amke is that the dataset covers high-reward transitions. But another challenge is that learning a policy that does something different from the observed dataset is difficult because its out of distribution. There are theoretical bounds on the error that come from Behavioural Cloning and DAgger, which are basically that we get an error bound that is at best quadratic in the time horizon H in the offline case, but linear in H in the online case. Also notes that in the offline case, MBRL can suffer from poor performance as a result of distribution shift.  [[papers/rl/offline/offline_reinforcement_learning_tutorial_levine.md|Notes]]

This is called "Soft Q Imitation Learning (SQIL)". This is a regularized variant of behavioural cloning which uses a sparsity prior to encourage long-horizon imitation. The algorithm gives a reward of 1 for all samples in the dataset and reward of zero for everything sampled online. In that sense, visiting states outside of the data manifold get low Q values due to the reward of zero, but going from an unknown-state back to a known state will get a positive reward (due to adding the log-sum-exponents of the next-state, next-action pairs).

This forces the number of entities to which the agent attends to be small. The query is a set of inducing points and a vector for the action under consideration and the keys come from the object.

 - [[pdfs/rl/planning/compositional_rl_logical_specifications.pdf|Compositional Reinforcement Learning from Logical Specifications.]]: (cite: journals/corr/abs-2106-13906/Jothimurugan/2021) Study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks given by logical specifications. This work develops a compositional learning approach called DIRL. First encode the specification into an abstract graph, then incorporate reinforcement learning to learn a policy for each edge within a Dijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan. In this case the high-level specifications are given by a formal language already. So to combine the two, the only learning that you need to do on the "high level" is estimate the probability that a policy for a given edge safely takes you from one node to the next. Then you can allocate the negative log probability as the "cost" for that edge, meaning that transitions that are less likely to be successful have a higher cost. The higher level planner which fuses all the policies together is just Djikstra's algorithm for finding a shortest path to complete the specification.

Addresses the challenge from a 2018 survey that there "has been no clear demonstration of successful planning with a learned model in the Atari Learning Environment". In the empirical evaluation, they find that SimPLE is "significantly more sample efficient" than a highly tuned Rainbow (though Rainbow can be tuned to have better results in the low-data regime). The model works by stacking four frames + the action selected by the agent and putting that through an encoder-decoder network with skip connections, then predicting the next frame. The next part of the model is a convolutional inference network which approximates the posterior given the next frame and discretizes it into latents. The idea is then to use the latent from the four previous frames to try and predict the latent code for the posterior (eg, when you know the next frame). During training, there is a "neural network simulated environment" (a world model) [[papers/rl/planning/model_based_rl_for_atari.md|Notes]]

The basic idea is similar to [[repaint_inpainting_using_denoising_diffusion_probabilistic_models]], eg, we treat the planning problem as an inference problem where the planning process is part of the model. Here we have a diffusion based model - we noise trajectories, then derive the appropriate backward process so that we can start out with noise and end up with trajectories. The key difference here is that the diffusion process is controllable - you add the gradients of some objective that you want your plans to meet. The authors show that you can stitch together in-distribution subsequences in order to generalize compositionally. You can also generalize to new tasks by using a guided diffusion process. This does well on eg, mazes . [[papers/rl/planning/diffusion/planning_with_diffusion_for_flexible_behavior_synthesis.md|Notes]]
### disentanglement
 - [[pdfs/rl/planning/disentanglement/composable_planning_with_attributes_disentanglement.pdf|Composable Planning with Attributes.]]: (cite: conf/icml/ZhangSLSF18) If the agent knows which properties of the environment are important, then after learning how its actions affect those properties, it may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without specifically training for them. This paper considers a setup where the environment is augmented with a set of user-defined attributes that parameterize features of interest and proposes to learn policies for transitioning between attributes and maintaining a graph of possible transitions. Effectively, the policy takes a pair of inputs, the current state and the attributes of a goal state and outputs a distribution over actions. This is similar to [[compositional_rl_logical_specifications]] in a way, since both methods also use a transition table, but in this case the attributes are provided by the neural network.

This is similar to [[papers/dl/rim|RIM]], except that it does feature attention instead of spatial attention. In the KeyBox task, generalization is tested in the densely-populated case and the sparsely populated case. Generalization is on the dimension of "more distractors" and "longer paths".

The results show that dimensionality strongly matters for task generation and disentanglement can lead to better auxiliary tasks but has limited benefits as an input representation. Compares a number of promising representation learning approaches as MONET, Transporter and beta-VAE.

In this sense, the critic can in theory be learned much faster because it operates on a reduced dimensionality input.

The main result is that is that even if the true value function of every policy is learning in a given set of features and off-policy data has good coverage over all the features, then any algorithm still requires a number of offline samples that is exponential in the problem horizon in order to non-trivially estimate the value of any given policy. Realizability (the condition that a a transformation exists from the features to the value function) and Good Coverage (the feature covariance matrix has lower-bounded eigenvalues, no eigenvalues aer zero) are not sufficient to get you efficient offline RL. Sample-efficient offline policy evaluation is not psosible unless singificantly stronger conditions hold, such as having low distribution shift or stronger representational conditions.  .

Sample efficiency performance is improving exponentially, with a doubling time of around 10-18 months on Atari, 5-24 months on state-based continuous control and 4-9 months on pixel-based continuous control. The main contributors to improved sample efficiency in practice have been (1) improved off-policy learning, (2) MBRL, (3) auxiliary training objectives, (4) incentives for sample efficiency, eg, explicit tuning of hyperparameters, such as frequency of updates to the Q network, (5) increased compute which enables new techniques like DDQN. However, progress might be slower for offline reinforcement learning, since you can't improve things with exploration.

Vision is based on learning a disentangled representation of the environment. Once the vision module is trained, DARLA can acquire many source policies that are robust to domain shifts. In the domain adaptation setting, the input distribution is modified bu the reward structure remains intact. DARLA relies on learning a latent state representation that is shared between the source and target domains by learning a disentangled representation of the environment's generative factors. The first stage learns an unsupervised mapping that utilises observations collected by a random policy (with sufficient variability of factors and their conjunctions). Then training the policy is conditioned on the disentangled view of the world. The disentangled representations are learned using a combination Beta-VAE and a denoising autoencoder. So the Beta-VAE in this case is actually taking the DAE latent state as inputs and learning to reconstruct it as opposed to reconstructing the whole image. To do transfer, evaluate the disentangling encoder on the target domain inputs, then evaluate the policy on the output of the disentangling encoder.

 - [[pdfs/rl/transfer/disentangled_cumulants_successor_representations_transfer.pdf|Disentangled Cumulants Help Successor Representations Transfer to New Tasks.]]: (cite: journals/corr/abs-1911-10866/Grimm/2019) Proposes a principled way to learn a basis set of policies which when recombined through generalised policy improvement, come with guarantees on the coverage of the final state space. First the agent learns to perform intrinsically generated goal-based tasks in the total abscence of rewards, then the agent leverages that experience to quickly acheive a high level of performance on externally specified tasks. A "successor feature" representation decouples the dynamics from the environment's reward function, basically the reward is a linear combination of the feature and some weight. GPI basically learns the "weight" for different reward funtions while keeping the successor features. The learned control policies during the first step (after disentangled feature discovery) "achieve a certain uniformly spread values for the learnt features". By learning a disentangled latent space with $z$ dimensions and discretising into $b$ bins, we can re-use the $zb$ feature control policies to solve $(b + 1)^z$ downstream goal-based tasks, where $b + 1$ includes the extra bin value per disentangled dimension which indicates whether the value is irrelevant to the task.

Presents a method to transfer from past demonstrations from similar MDPs using normalizing flows. The basic idea is to learn a function using a dataset of past trajectories on similar tasks which maps from noise to likely actions. Then you can use that downstream to learn a new task faster: random exploration corresponds to taking useful actions, since you map the random noise into "likely" actions. This results in much faster downstream learning on a variety of grasping tasks. The idea is that sampling from the gaussian distribution doesn't just do random things, it does random things that happen to be potentially useful actions on various tasks. Now all the agent needs to do is choose from which of those random potentially useful actions will it do. Note that this is different from just doing transfer learning, since transfer learning transfers an entire policy, not a distribution of policies, meaning that you might have to "unlearn" good behaviour, go back to random exploration and "re-learn" the behaviour that you want.
