Subsumptionf or making an administative decision in an AI context. Rule-based vs machine learning.

Subsumption: "If X then Y". A syllogism.

In a state based on rule of law, all decisions of a legal nature must be subsumed under general legal rules, so decisions must be based on applying law to facts.

Subsumption is a core technique of decisionmaking, performed by public servants, but this can be translated into automatized decisionmaking by public authorities.

Machine-learning does not produce subsumption, but a prediction of how a future case will be decised. Data-driven, statistics and only indirect connection with teh rule of law.
 - **Question**:
 - But this is only true where we're just trying to follow precedent.
 - Surely you can define a system that only operates in the area of precedent, eg, determining whether a particular fact exists.
 - For example, instead of trying to make the decision directly, it probably makes more sense for an ML system to determine whether a fact exists or doesn't, then applies the rule based on the actual rules. So ML systems should not answer questions of **law**.


Question: I can understand why using ML-based ADM to directly make decisions is problematic, because its not applying rules, its applying precedents - which is not the same thing as applying a logical process. But do you think that (assuming proper safeguards etc) there's role for ML systems to play in identifying whether a *fact* or a *predicate* exists? Or are there issues with subsumption into precedent as well?

 - As the sitution is now, it would be very difficult to take into operation such a system that would at the same time fulfil the requirement that you make a subsumption. I see complications in that respect. But there is a utility in having advanced and more dynamic systems in place that could perform this operation, but I'm doubt about whether these systems.





Rule-based ADM is compatible with formal rule of law, machine learning ADM not compatible with formal rule of law.

Notes on the EU draft: Subsumption considered a "high risk use", eg, "applying the law to a concrete set of facts".

Broad listing of AI-techniques -> enumeration in Annex 1 -> confusing?

Example: Vero. Sending wrong decisions to people.


Finland, Government bills in constitutuonal committee:
 - (1) experiment with basic income, potentially a high risk use of AI

Migration law context: How exactly the system should be set up in order to provide the correct decisions. Constitutional court concerned with procedural rule of law and wants to improve the detail in the decisionmaking.

Constitution requires a lot of from the legal framework surrounded automatized decisionmaking, probably other constitutions too.

CC bractice: ADM problems appeared in high risk use of Annex III.

At least two cases of Government Bills enacted where ADM provision exlcuded.
