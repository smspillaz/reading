Main issue is "static vs dynamic" algorithms. What happens if the weights behind the algorithm change during the period that it is in use? Is the issue here for rule-of-law that two people with the same situation can receive different outcomes depending on the point in time at which they interact with the system?

Comment: If we can find any examples of systems that use online learning in public administration, we would be astonished. Usually model-retraining doesn't happen.

 - People don't understand the models to start with.

Follow up: As Mathias identifies, we're examining the issue of online learning as a "dynamic system". If there is a rule-of-law issue with dynamic systems, then this seems to be in conflict with machine learning engineering best practices where you usually *want* online learning, eg, monitoring distribution shifts, updating your system as the context changes etc. I understand there are also some obligations for vendors to consider this in the proposed EC regulations about this as well. So it seems like there is a tradeoff

 - "It depends": Legal conditions for automated decisionmaking, but this must go hand-in-hand with national legislation. There is now an official rule in the swedish administrative procedure act
 - There are legally competent people working in the system design environment. There might be a new context and depending on how you approach the system deisgn there might be some issues with rule of law.
 - "Let law play a pro-active role" as opposed to a merely reactive problem solving mechanism.
