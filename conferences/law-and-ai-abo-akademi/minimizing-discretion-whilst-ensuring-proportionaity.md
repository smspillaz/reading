Human discretion can act as a safeguard and add "humanity" and "fairness" to the application of law.

Which proportionality when?
	- different proportionality principles
	- not restricted to clear human/constitutional rights contexts: potential to infliltrate commonplace intereactions between public authorities and citizens
	- impact of proportionality of proportionality not confined to human rights, has the potential to infiltrate and become much more important in other areas that are not "rights based"
	- substantive requirements
	- proportionality difficult to automate.
	
	
Proportionality may be assessed at different levels:
 - legislative
	 - proportionality embedded in legislation
 - implementation
	 - proportionaltiy of individual decision
 - ex post
	 - legislation and decision
	 - courts



Efforts to define and install digital-registration might be better done by an increased conferral of legislative powers to actual rule-writers, because parliament doesn't have the time to go over all the details.

 - **Challenge**: We can't expect ADM to be completely proportionate when applying the rules
 - Proportionality might require more proportional rules
 - How to handle new circumstnaces.


Proprotionality as a key to keeping the application of "the law" in the loop.

The responsibiltiy of humans inthe loop goes beyond checking the reasonableness of decisions, but they also need to be equopped to assessing proportionality.

Article 22 of the GDPR: Procedural right to have a human in the loop.

"Trustworthy AI": There has been some criticism of that proposal because it doens't take into account systemtic level risk. But if you look at proportionality, there is "hypothetical" proportionality or "presumptive" proportionality on the idea that you have a trustworthy system.

Collective proportionality: trustworthiness is a strong point

Trust could be both well-founded and unfounded at the same time. System-level trust -we can show that the system seemingly works well but in an individual case it does not work well. But it does not mean that the system is unproportional as a whole, but how should we ensure that unproportional decisions are not made in cases where circumstances are unforeseen.
