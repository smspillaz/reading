A public official who uses an information system cannot identify the factors related to the decisionmaking. This is a problem for accountability and administrative law.


ADM needs data. Quality of information issue:
 - Understandability
 - Traceability
 - Machine readability
 - Usability
 - Availability
 - Utility
 - Coverage
 - Consistency
 - Timeliness
 - Accuracy
 - Validity


APA: An authority shall ensure that a matter is sufficiently and **appropriately** examined, by acquiring the information required to do so.

Authority: Law is not keeping up with the developments with different solutions that technology offers - we are proceeding with the technology first and then the law catching up. But there is plenty of law drafting going on concerning ADM.

There are various laws that impact on automatized decisionmaking in terms of systematization.

A question to Matthias Spielkamp which I wish all to see: In the discussion after prof. Voutilainens contribution,** I asked about situations where two systems of automatized decision-making speak with each other or one system of ADM is searching information in registers of other public authorities. Such situations could involve a number of complications.** Do you at AlgorithmWatch have experiences from such situations? This could be a topic for the Closing Discussion.
