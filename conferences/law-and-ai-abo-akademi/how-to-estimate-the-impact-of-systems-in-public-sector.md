Main findings:
 - ADM is already a part of everyday life for many europeans


Actual uses:
 - Predict risk of gender-based value
 - Predict live events (insurance)


Automated society is very opaque, there is a fundamental lack of transparency.

Our idea:
 - There shoudl be a public register of ADM systems used within the public sector
 - Why only the public sector? No alternative to the public sector. Cannot opt out.


To create a meaningful accountability framework:
 - Develop and establish approaches to effective audit such systems.\


Impact Assessments:
 - Automated decisionmaking systems in the public sector. Impact assessemnt tool for public authorities:
 -  When ADMS are deployed in the public sector, authorities should be obliged to systematically evaluate and make transparent the risks
 -  The risks cannot be determined in a generalized manner, but on a case-by-case basis.



Checklist 1:
 - Transparency triage for ADMS
 - Harm Prevention
	 - Avoidability: Can individuals avoid the decision or demand that the decision is taken by a different proceudre not involving the same technical system?
 - Justice and Fairness:
	- Statistical Proxy Risk: Does the system rely on a statistical model of behaviour or personal characteristics? This is not to say that it is problematic if it is the former, but if it is the case, then we have certaint transparency requirements.
- Autonomy:
	- Ignorance risk: Does the technical system make judgements that the public administration employees lack the competence or confidence to override or overrule.

Transparency Report: Checklist 2:
	- What is the problem that the system is designed to solve?
	- Accountability: Who is responsible for the design of the system and who is responsibile for the implementation of the system and its outcomes.
	- Translation and control transparency: What methodology has been used totest the performance of the system
	- Performance transparency: If there have been test runs, how do you perform? How do you compare to the one previously in place or to established benchmarks?
