# Value Sensitive Design

What is important to people with a focus on ethics and morality.

Inetractional theory and method that accounts for human values in a principled and structured manner throughout the design process.

We know that technology will be appropriated in unintended ways.

Direct and indirect stakeholders: Eg, if you're talking loudly on the phone on a bus, you're affecting the indirect stakeholders (other passengers).

Tripartite methodology.
 - Conceptual Investigations
 - Technical Investigations
 - Empirical Investigations


# Real world Examples

Fixed character length on twitter:
 - English vs Kinyarwanda
 - By fixing the character length, you're giving more communicative potential to some groups over other.


Bias in computer systems:
 - systematic and unfair discrimination against certain individuals or groups of individuals in favor of others
 - must be **systematic** and **unfair**. Sometimes discrimination can be **fair**

Three sources of bias:
 - Pre-existing (social institutions, encoding practices and attitudes)
 - Technical bias
 - Emergent bias (arises in context of use)

Real world projects in NLP:
 - Documentation toolkit for NLP systems.

# Design Activities

*Sleeve* is a hypotehtical embodies technology which uses a BCI to detect the wearer's feelings. Fabric can change colors and texture according to feelings of wearer. Can be wearn by people such as autistic persons.

*Children*: Often appropriate systems orginally designed for adults. How might this system influence a child's socail or moral development?

 - Feedback loops
 - Consent of the user - purchaser vs user
 - As an indirect stakeholder : how to interpret something complex like emotion?

Ability to develop finer-grained emotional perspective. Exxageration of emotion.

*Value Tensions*: When one value challenges another value. Sharing information supports sociability but reduces privacy. Or independence vs interdepenence.

*Cultural assumption:* In any cultures, expression of emotion is not open. Eg, knowing that someone is unhappy in public is probably going to make other people feel uncomfortable. In some cultures public display of emotion is very important.

# Artificial Intelligence within Reason

1. Structure - some structures make things easy, some make things hard
2. Scale - relative or proportionate size or extent
3. Time

Materiality

Accumulative Harm - scale matters. One person walking across a forest does not harm. If a million people walk across at the same time, you will kill it.

Nuclear power: 

 - Structure: unsolved deadly residue
 - Scale: samll amount extremely harmful
 - Time: Isotopes can decay very slow. P-239 has a half-life of 24,000



# Conclusion

1. There are methods
2. Use human values as a riteria for evaluating system performance
3. Co-evolve technology and socail structure
4. Think long term and at scale
5. Planet finite yet regenerative
6. Have the courage not to build
